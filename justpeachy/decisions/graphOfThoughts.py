1. Represent the problem-solving process as a graph
2. Define a set od operations that can be performed as a graph
3. Implement a framework for executing the graph
4. Assess the validity and quality of the generated thoughts

    def __init__(self, nodes, edges):
        self.nodes = nodes
        self.edges = edges

        for output in outputs:
